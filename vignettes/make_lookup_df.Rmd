The lookup table has information on drug category, class and synonyms.  It is made from the DEA and "No Slang" tables. The core of the table is the dea_factsheets table.  It is tweaked to simplify complex names 

## Fix dea_brands

The dea brands file has:

+ mixed case
+ registered trademark symbols 
+ The drugs *kadian* is together with *ms cotlin* as a single record

```{r}
dea_brands <- DOPE::dea_brands %>%
  rename("brand" = brands) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), tolower)) %>%
  mutate(brand = str_remove_all(brand, "Â®")) %>%
  mutate(brand = case_when(brand == "kadianms-contin" ~ "kadian", # two names
                           TRUE ~ brand)) %>%
  bind_rows(c(class = "morphine", brand = "ms contin"))
```

## Fix DEA category and class

The fact sheet file has:

+ mixed case
+ ghb listed with a complex name
    + gamma-hydroxybutyric acid should appear as ghb in all "class" variables
+ Mdma listed with 3 names 
    + ecstacy, molly and mdma should be appear as mdma in all "class" variables
+ peyote and mescalin grouped together
    + peyote and mescalin should appear as mescalin in all "class" variables
+ flakka is listed with a complex name
    + flakka should appear as flakka in all "class" variables
    
These two do not fit well    

+	spice/ k2, synthetic marijuana
+	acetaminophen and oxycodone	
	

```{r}
dea_class_cat <- DOPE::dea_factsheets %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), tolower)) %>%
  mutate(class =
           case_when(class == "peyote and mescaline" ~ "mescaline", 
                     class == "ghb - gamma-hydroxybutyric acid" ~ "ghb",
                     class == "ecstasy or mdma (also known as molly)" ~ "mdma",
                     class == "flakka (alpha-pvp)" ~ "flakka",
                     	
                     TRUE ~ class))

```

## The DEA street name file has:

+ mixed case
+ fentanyl has a complex name
    + fentanyl should appear as fentanyl in all "class" variables


```{r}
dea_street_names <- DOPE::dea_street_names %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.character), tolower)) %>%
  mutate(class =
           case_when(class == "fentanyl and fentanyl derivatives"	~ "fentanyl",
                     TRUE ~ class))

```
